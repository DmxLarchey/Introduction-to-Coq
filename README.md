[Introduction to the Coq proof assistant](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=3076&dsrid=195&courseNr=192098&semester=2020S) (TUWEL online course)

## Learning outcomes

After successful completion of the course, students are able to understand 
and use the Coq proof assistant; in particular to formalize propositional logic, 
quantifiers inductive types and inductive predicates

## Subject of course

This course gives an introduction to the Coq proof assistant:

_Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the certification of properties of programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, the Verified Software Toolchain for verification of C programs, or the Iris framework for concurrent separation logic), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem, or homotopy type theory), and teaching._

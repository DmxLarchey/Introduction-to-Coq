# Modeling and proving the Towers of Hanoi

The goal of the project is to model the game of
the [Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).
Ultimately, we show that well know recursive sequence of moves
is correct, ie. it can displace a full tower from the left rod 
to the right rod, using the middle rod as temporary storage. 

The standalone Coq source file [`hanoi.v`](hanoi.v) contains
code to achieve this outcome. Your goal is to _fill the holes_
which are totally or partially admitted proof scripts.

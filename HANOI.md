# Modeling and proving the Towers of Hanoi

## Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to model the game of
the [Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).
Ultimately, we show that the well know recursive sequence of moves
is correct, ie. it can displace a full tower from the left rod/tower 
to the right rod/tower, using the middle rod/tower as temporary storage. 

The standalone Coq source file [`hanoi.v`](hanoi.v) contains
code to achieve this outcome. Your goal is to _fill the holes_
which are totally or partially admitted proof scripts.

For those willing to go further, some suggested improvments appear
at the end of the project file.

## Expectations and Timetable

The project starts May 20th 2020 and lasts one month. It is an 
**individual project** and students will be required to send a 
completed project file to me [Dominique Larchey-Wendling](mailto:larchey@loria.fr) 
after that one month period has expired. The deadline is fixed 
on **June 22th 2020**. Please contact me if you have any question
or difficulty regarding the project.

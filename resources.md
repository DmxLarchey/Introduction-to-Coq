# Resource for Students in the upcoming Coq lessons

- The first course will take place as scheduled:
  * Tuesday May 5, 2020, 13:00-15:00

- Before that, I will need to collect the e-mail
  of all the students to be able to contact them
  directly.

- Due to the move of the lessons fully virtual, we will
  try to focus on what is most interactive,
  ie the lab sessions.

- Following the lessons:
  * a computer (a smartphone/tablet won't work)
  * a microphone and headphones (mandatory)
  * camera is a plus
  * the Discord app: discordapp.com
    - free of charge, allows screen sharing
    - works in a navigator (tested on Chrome)
    - standalone apps for Linux, Windows & IOS
  - need to register a (free) account on discordapp.com
  - the account of the teacher is: **Dominique Larchey-Wendling#0283**

- For lab. sessions, the students need to install
  `Coq` and `CoqIDE` on their own computer
  - no need to get the latest version (`v8.11`)
  - anything above `Coq 8.8` (3 years old) will work
  - the [`Coq` main site](https://coq.inria.fr)
  - for Linux, try in that order:
    1/ install coq & coqide available for your distribution
    2/ https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Installation-of-Coq-on-Linux
    3/ or install it through `opam 2` (for experts)
  - installing `Coq` for Windows or Mac users:
    - there are [packages in here](https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.11.0)

- For support material:
  - recommended reads:
    - [very short summary](https://coq.inria.fr/a-short-introduction-to-coq)
    - less short: the first 20 pages of [C. Paulin's introduction course](https://www.lri.fr/~paulin/LASER/course-notes.pdf) 
    - [The Coq'Art book](https://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt) (reference)
  - their are many Coq courses available online
    - eg. https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/CoqInTheClassroom
  - we will roughtly follow the [course of P. Casteran](https://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/FM/Logique):
